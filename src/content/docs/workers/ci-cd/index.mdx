You can set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) for your Workers project by using either the native build system, [Workers Builds](#workers-builds), or using [third-party services](#external-cicd) to optimize your development workflow.

## Why use CI/CD?

It is best practice to deploy your Workers with a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build and deployment process instead of running adhoc deployments manually using `wrangler deploy`. This approach ensures that your Worker is consistently built and deployed in the same environment to reduce variability. Additionally, it simplifies managing access to production credentials.

## Workers Builds

[Workers Builds](/workers/ci-cd/builds) is Cloudflare's native CI/CD system that allows you to integrate with GitHub or GitLab, and automatically deploy your changes with each new commit.

## External CI/CD

You can also choose to set up your CI/CD pipeline with an external provider.
