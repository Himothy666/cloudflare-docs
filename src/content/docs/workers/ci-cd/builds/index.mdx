Workers Builds allows you to connect an existing Worker to a GitHub or GitLab repository to set up automatic builds and deployments for your development workflow. 

## Get Started

To set up your Git integration with Workers:

1. **Select your Worker** in the dashboard and navigate to Settings > Build 
2. **Select the Git provider** you'd like to connect to by clicking "Connect". Follow the prompts to install the Cloudflare application on your git account.
3. **Configure your build settings** by selecting your desired git repository, branch, and configuring a deploy command and optionally a build command.
4. **Push a commit** to your repository to trigger your first build and deploy.


## View Build Details

Once a build is in progress, you can monitor its build logs and view build history by navigating to **"View build history"** on the deployments tab of your Worker. If successful, you can also view the build details for each new [version](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/) created. ## Build Limits
